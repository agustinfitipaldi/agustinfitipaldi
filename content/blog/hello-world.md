# Welcome to my blog!

This is a test post to verify that the blog functionality is working correctly. The blog supports standard Markdown features like:

## Headers

### And sub-headers

- Lists
- With multiple
- Items

1. Numbered lists
2. Work too

**Bold text** and _italic text_ are supported.

> Blockquotes work as well

And of course, `inline code` and code blocks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

Enjoy writing!
