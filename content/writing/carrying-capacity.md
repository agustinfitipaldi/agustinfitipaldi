title: lay opinions on carrying capacity

Viewing politics as a generalized effort to coordinate opinions and make decisions for a group of people, how do we reckon with the notion of a carrying capacity when it comes to different political systems?

Used more often in a biological context, the carrying capacity of a region with respect to some organism, refers to the maximum number of that organism the region can sustain in equilibrium. Being generous with our meaning, however, and looking at variety as opposed to number, and considering the 'organism' in this case to be an opinion, and the 'region' to be a political system, we arrive at a new definition. The maximum breadth of opinions a political system can sustain in equilibrium.

This is not really new at all--although my research is limited--but it seems to go under the name of political pluralism, or tolerance. I aim to read more on this in due time, but for now I wanted to jot down some thoughts as a track of ideas.

Namely that I think the United States has surpassed its carrying capacity. I think, as all things, this is a factor of various forces, but the main one I don't think gets much attention is, the internet.

The idea goes as follows: the internet is, contrary perhaps to gut feeling, a net negative on democracy. More broadly speaking, when it comes to dispersal of information, perhaps more is not always better[^1]. The writing I always come back to when I think of this is from Federalist Paper #10 by Madison, in the midst of a section talking about the size of a republic and its effects on the spread of opinion, he says:

> The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States.

The idea behind this being that the number of people as well as the physical spread of them will assist in adjusting the cost for grifters looking to wreak havoc on an election. This logic seems perfectly serviceable for Madison's time, as it was indeed a challenge to communicate anything on a national scale. But is that the case anymore?

The advent of the internet brought many magical things to our society, but perhaps most importantly, was the ability to connect across large distances almost instantaneously. We now have tremendous systems in place placing billions of people in contact with each other at the tap of a finger. It's incredible. But what does it do to the spread of opinions? How does it help or hurt our political systems from a time when the speed of opinion was measured in days and not milliseconds?

Through this instantaneous connection, the immune system of our democracy has been almost entirely dominated. It takes no longer than half a day to spread an infectious idea to a quorum of the population. Many things can be said about the benefits of this, its ability to bring awareness to dark corners of our society that in other times may have never been called out deserves a commendation. But in weighing sides, I say it becomes difficult to settle on the idea that its more good than bad.

Bringing it back to the point of carrying capacity, however, it seems clear to me that the existence of such a system of magical communication must necessarily reduce the carrying capacity for a democracy. Whereas before, when each opinion was counted only once, by itself, now has an outsized influence beyond its traditional borders. As the system gets faster and more informed, it becomes heavier and more aware of its size.

I think this has two main vectors of attack on said democracy, the effect on the spread of 'bad' ideas, and the inability to reach quick consensus. The more the light is shined into the corners of society, the more attention needs to be dedicated in understanding and incorporating those areas into the general plan. This of course is a good thing, but its cost to the decision process starts growing exponentially with the number of corners included.

Therefore, from these hurried thoughts, it appears that the natural conclusion is not necessarily to get rid of the internet, but rather to greatly reduce the size of our decision bodies. More, smaller, states. Each more responsive to its populous than they ever could have been all together.

As mentioned previously, this is nothing but a back of the napkin thoughts in progress. Stapled to a bulletin board in the middle of nowhere. But if you have thoughts on this or people to read from, I look forward to hearing from you :)
